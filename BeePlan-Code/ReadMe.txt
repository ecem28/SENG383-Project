In this task, I implemented the scheduling algorithm for the BeePlan system using Python.
The implementation includes:

Backtracking + heuristic scheduling algorithm for conflict-free weekly timetables

Clean Code structure (separated modules: scheduler, validator, conflict_checker, models, exceptions)

Custom error handling (InstructorConflictError, CapacityError, RuleViolationError, input validation errors)

Constraint checks:

Instructor availability

Friday exam block (13:20–15:10)

Lab-theory order

Classroom capacity & type

Max 4 theory hours/day per instructor

CENG/SENG elective conflict prevention

The project was written using Copilot, and AI-generated code was reviewed and refined by me.
All files are included in the BeePlan-Code folder.
