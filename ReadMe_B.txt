KidTask Coding Implementation — Student B

This folder contains the KidTask system implementation created using Cursor AI.
All logic is implemented inside main.py, including:

- User class with roles (parent, child)
- Task assignment and completion logic
- Permission checks and error handling
- Simple modular design

All code written and reviewed by Student B.


UPDATE - BeePlan Project

The BeePlan system has been implemented as part of the project.

My recent contributions as Student B:

- Algorithm: Even distribution of classes over 5 days

- Restriction: Maximum 4 hours of instructor classes per day

- Reporting: Turkish language verification reports page.

AI Analysis Card:

Prompt: "Add a maximum of 4 hours of instructor classes per day."
AI Output: Completely removed the 5-hour class.
